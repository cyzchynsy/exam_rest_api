# exam_rest_api
Create a REST API using NodeJS + Express with at least two (2) resources/entities including the User entity. Make sure that your REST API is able to handle GET (all), GET (single), POST, PUT, and DELETE requests for each of your resources/entities, including the login and register requests.

A REST API about User, and Music (Artist => Album => Songs)

Good morning Sir! Here's my finals output for CS217. I couldn't use Postman to its full function
because I had trouble understanding its uses but I did connect my source codes
to mongoDB and I was able to register and login using Postman.

  | => UPDATE (1/06/2023): I was able to use MongoDB and Postman for API testing
  

I made this by following your examples in the pdf you sent, and I was able to create one.

Following your example of Program => Curriculum => Course, I made Artist => Album => Song

When I ran the "npm start" in the IDE's terminal, there is no error encountered and it printed "Server listening on 3001"

I uploaded these files using Git through VS Code as I could not import files via upload since there are over 5,000+ files.

I didn't copy anything and I use the guide for creating REST api as the only guide in making this output

In connecting to MongoDB, I watched several video resources online.

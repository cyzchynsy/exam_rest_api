Good morning Sir! Here's my finals output for CS217. I couldn't use Postman to its full function
because I had trouble understanding its uses but I did connect my source codes
to mongoDB and I was able to register and login using Postman.

Following your example of Program => Curriculum => Course, I made Artist => Album => Song

When I ran the "npm start" in the IDE's terminal, there is no error encountered and it printed "Server listening on 3001"
